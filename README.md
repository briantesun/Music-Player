# Music-Player

Note: I completed this project as part of a university course, so I'm unable to post the code publicly. If you want to see the code directly, I believe I can show it to you privately.

Summary: A feature-rich music player app that allows users to play songs in various modes as well as manage their playlists and song library. The app uses Java ADTs to optimized data handling for a fast, error-free user experience.
