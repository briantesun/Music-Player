# Music-Player

Note: I completed this project as part of a university course, so I'm unable to post the code publicly. If you want to see the code directly, I believe I can show it to you privately.

Summary: A simulated music player app that allows a user to manage multiple playlists, play songs in various modes, and easily update their song library. The app utilizes Java ADTs (TreeMap, Stack, PriorityQueue, Hashtable, HashMap, HashSet, ArrayList) for an efficient and user-friendly system.
